# ANNProfiler
A python utility to measure the time and accuracy of neural networks trained on the MNIST dataset.

User can choose to meausure how various factors affect the training speed and training accuracy of a neural network and visually see the results in a matplotlib graph.
These factors include:
  - Number of neurons per hidden layer in each network
  - Number of hidden layers in each networks
  - Number of epochs trained for each network
 
 Dependencies:
  Tensorflow (For GPU support follow tensorflow's instructions on how to set up tensorflow with a gpu as it is different for each operating system)
  Matplotlib
